// You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top. 
// Your solution will need to be optimized to run in O(n) time complexity.
// 
// Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
// Sample Input 0: 5
// Sample Output 0: 8
// Sample Input 1: 10
// Sample Output 1: 89
