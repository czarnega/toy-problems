Prompt: 
	Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

		The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
		The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
		So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

	Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made
	from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

Constraints:
	* No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. 
	* You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

Example:
	
	var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

	getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday); // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

*/

const getMaxProfit = (array) => {
	let minPrice = array[0];
	let maxProfit = 0;

	for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		let currentPrice = array[i];
		
		// check to see if currentPrice is less than minPrice,
		// if so, set minPrice to currentPrice
		minPrice = currentPrice < minPrice ? currentPrice : minPrice;
		
		// calculate potentialProfit
		const potentialProfit = currentPrice - minPrice;
		
		// check to see if potentialProfit is greater than maxProfit,
		// if so, set maxProfit to potentialProfit
		maxProfit = potentialProfit > maxProfit ? potentialProfit : maxProfit;
	}

	return maxProfit;
}
